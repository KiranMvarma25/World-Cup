        <p>
            Welcome to my India's cricket world cup journey 2023 blog! I'm Kiran Varma, graduate, loves cricket, had explored all of Indian matches.
            Join me on my journey to witness each and every match that India played at ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. This wonderful and amazing tournament 
            was hosted by India. India was the runner up of the tournament, but the way they played throughout the tournament was tremendous. 
            Summary of each match has been explained in each blog. In the below navigation bar below you will find results of each match and 
            the performances. I hope you will enjoy and will have the great experience from my blog. Join my journey togetherly can have great memories.
