    <h2>India vs New Zealand</h2>
    <h3>Shami stunns New Zealand.</h3>
    <p>
        Virat Kohli's 95, following Mohammed Shami's 5-54 in his first World Cup 2023 game, helped India beat New Zealand by four wickets to take the top spot in the points table.
        A late collapse triggered by Shami kept the then table-toppers to 273 despite Daryl Mitchell's career-best 130. Kohli's knock built on the platform set by Rohit Sharma in the Powerplay, kept India's chase on track despite the ebbs and flows.
