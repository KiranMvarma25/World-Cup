    <h2>India vs Australia</h2>
    <h3>Heart Break for Host Nation India</h3>
    <p>
        Five time Champions Australia made it to sixth time by clinching yet another World Cup trophy after 2015.
        They upsets the host nation India with 6 wicket win. Australia's bowlers put the chokehold to restrict India to 240, 
        The chase was not without stutters early on, as Australia slipped to 47/3, it was Travis Head who delivered the final 
        slam with his rollicking 120-ball 137.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        After 10 consecutive wins to reach the final, India were outplayed by Australia on a slow Ahmedabad pitch.
        The pitch in Ahmedabad, slower and drier than expected, played a crucial role. India's strategy didn't adapt well, 
        especially in the second innings when the pitch conditions changed, failing to leverage the slower nature in their favour.
